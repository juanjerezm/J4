### Determining cooling cost of electric chiller
The cost of the electric chiller is approximated by comparing it to the heat pump, using its efficiency and variable cost.

The variable cost is adjusted to â‚¬/MWh~cold~ by, using the HP's nameplate efficiency (COP) :
$$
C_{HP_{cold}} = C_{HP_{heat}}  \frac{COP_{h}}{COP_{h} - 1}
$$

This value would represent the variable cost of a heat pump per unit of cold produced. This cost is then scaled by the relative efficiency of the electric chiller, whose source is detailed in my papers. The variable cost of the electric chiller is then obtained by:
$$
C_{EC_{cold}} = C_{HP_{heat}}  \frac{COP_{HP_{heat}}}{COP_{EC_{cold}}}
$$
